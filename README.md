# Shares Portfolio Application

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

A user should be able to:

- view total current value.
- view individual and total performance trends.
- retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
- View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

## Example Extensions

- Speculation based on trends and further financial modelling using projections.
